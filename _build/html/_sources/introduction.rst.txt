What is sdcApp?
---------------

sdcApp is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the R package sdcMicro (see
`here <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/index.html>` ). The sdcApp 
opens the functionality of sdcMicro to users not familiar with the statistical
programming language R. sdcMicro

All functionality available in the sdcMicro package is also available in the sdcApp.
The sdcApp allows to anonymize microdata with sdcMicro without any knowledge of R.

What is the purpose of the manual?
----------------------------------

This manual is designed to provide step-by-step guidance in the process of anonymizing a
dataset with microdata. Both the background information on methods and measures is 
provided as well as instructions on how to complete these steps in sdcApp. As sdcApp is a 
GUI for the sdcMicro package, R users can also carry out the anonymization process from
command-line in R. More information and guidance on using sdcMicro from command-line 
is available in the SDC Practice Guide available `here <https://sdcpractice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`.
This guide also provides more detailed background information on SDC.
