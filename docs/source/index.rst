sdcApp manual
=============

This is documentation and guidance for *sdcApp*, a user interface for the *sdcMicro* *R* 
package, which provides tools for Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) for microdata, 
also known as microdata anonymization. For an introduction to the theory and practice of Statistical Disclosure Control please see our accompanying guide: 
`Statistical Disclosure Control for Microdata: Theory <https://sdctheory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

As *sdcApp* is a GUI for the *R* package *sdcMicro*, users familiar with using *R* for statistical analysis
may prefer to carry out the anonymization process using *R* from command-line. 
More information and guidance on using *sdcMicro* from command-line 
is available in the 
`Statistical Disclosure Control for Microdata: A Practice Guide for sdcMicro <https://sdcpractice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
from the same authors.
