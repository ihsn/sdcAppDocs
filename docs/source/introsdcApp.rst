Introduction to sdcApp
=======================

*sdcApp* is a user-friendly application for microdata anonymization 
and is built on the `Shiny <https://shiny.rstudio.com>`_
technology. *Shiny* allows users to 
communicate through a GUI that runs in a webbrowser with a local *R* session. The local
*R* session performs the necessary calculations. In the case of *sdcApp*, most functionality 
used in *R* is included in the `sdcMicro <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sdcMicro>`_
package.

*sdcApp* has a tab structure and consists of seven tabs, which in turn consist of 
up to three panels. This structured is further explored below. 
The tabs and panels are used to navigate through the app.

Starting sdcApp
-----------------
After succcesful installation (see the Section `Installation and updating <installation.html>`__), 
*sdcApp* is ready for use. Every single time *sdcApp* is used, 
first the applications *R* or *RStudio* need to be opened. We recommend to use *RStudio*
for ease of use. After launching *R* or *RStudio*, 
the *sdcMicro* package needs to be loaded and *sdcApp* needs to be launched. 
To load *sdcMicro* and launch *sdcApp*, enter the code as shown in :numref:`code1` in the *R* console.
Press enter after each line to execute the line of code. :numref:`fig31` shows the
output in the *R* console after successfully launching *sdcApp*.

.. code-block:: R
   :linenos:
   :caption: Loading sdcMicro package and launching sdcApp
   :name: code1
   
   # Load sdcMicro package
   library(sdcMicro)
   
   # Launch sdcApp (opens in browser window)
   sdcApp()
   
.. NOTE:: 
	You can omit the lines starting with a hash tag (:code:`#`) as these are comment lines
	and ignored by the *R* interpreter.
   
The application opens in a new tab in your default web browser. In case you prefer to use
an alternative web browser, you can simply copy the address of the localhost and paste it into
a different browser on the same machine. The localhost address can be
found in the output in the *R* console. The address starts with :code:`http://127.0.0.1:` followed
by a four digit number. In the example in :numref:`fig31`, the full localhost address is
:code:`http://127.0.0.1:3256`. The application opens on the **About/Help** tab (see :numref:`fig32`).

.. NOTE::
	Firewalls and other settings on your computer and browser may prevent *sdcApp* from opening
	in your webbrowser. As a first thing you could try to copy paste the localhost address
	into your webbrowser. If that is not successful, try changing the settings of your 
	browser and firewall.

Tab and panel structure
-----------------------

The sdcApp consists of seven different tabs that serve different parts of the 
SDC process. The tabs can be selected in the navigation
bar at the top of the page (cf. the area indicated with 1 in :numref:`fig33`). 
The navigation bar is visible at all times. The content of each tab may change as 
function the specified SDC problem and the current state of the SDC process. For example, 
anonymization methods for continuous key variables are not shown on the **Anonymize** tab, 
if no continuous key variables are selected.

- About/Help
	Landing page to set storage path, quit and restart *sdcApp* as well as provide feedback to the developers
- Microdata
	Page to load, view, explore and prepare the microdata to be anonymized
- Anonymize
	Page to setup the anonymization problem (select variables, set parameters). Once the 
	problem is defined, this page shows a summary of the anonymization problem and allows
	to apply anonymization methods
- Risk/Utility
	Page to evaluate disclosure risk and information loss (data utility)
- Export Data
	Page to export the anonymized data and reports on the anonymization process
- Reproducibility
	Page with functionality to guarantee the reproducibility of the process by exporting the 
	*R* script or problem instance
- Undo
	Page to revert one or several steps in the anonymization process

Each tab consists of two panels: the left sidebar (cf. the area indicated with 2 in :numref:`fig33`) 
and the main panel (cf. the area indicated with 3 in :numref:`fig33`). The left panel 
allows the user to navigate between different function on the same tab, e.g., different 
risk measures. Some tabs have an additional right sidebar (cf. the area indicated with 4 in :numref:`fig33`), 
which provide summary information on the current SDC problem.

In-app help
-----------------
By hovering with the mouse pointer over the |icon| icon in *sdcApp*, additional information on
e.g., specific parameters and the interpretation of results is provided. The help information
is mainly intended to provide a brief reminder and is not meant to replace a thorough 
study of the SDC literature on risk and utility measurement and anonymization methods. 
:numref:`fig36` shows the help pop-up for the variable selection table.

Getting started
---------------

Use testdata dataset: all examples in this guide are illustrated with the testdata dataset.


Set storage path
----------------
All output exported from *sdcApp*, such as the anonymized dataset, reports and scripts will be 
saved in the directory shown under the header **Set storage path** on the **About/Help** 
tab (cf. :numref:`fig34`). Upon launching *sdcApp*, this directory is set to the *R* working 
directory. Change the working directory to a the folder in the project directory with the 
dataset to be anonymized by typing the path to this folder in the input box (cf. :numref:`fig34`). 
Once a valid path on your computer is entered, click the blue button **Update the current output
path** to change the path. If the entered path is not a valid path on your system, a red button appears
with the text **The specified directory does not exist, thus the path can't be updated**. 
It is recommended to create a new folder in the project directory for the *sdcApp* output.
The file names of the output files contain a date and time stamp as well as a brief description, 
e.g., exportedData_sdcMicro_20181010_1211.dta for the anonymized microdata in STATA format
on October 10, 2018 at 12:11 and exportedProblem_sdcMicro_20180304_1633.rdata for the 
saved problem instance as *R* datafile on March 4, 2018 ar 16:33.

.. NOTE:: 
	The storage path to the output folder needs to be specified every time *sdcApp* is 
	launched.

.. NOTE:: 
	If an sdcProblem is saved and reloaded, the storage path is set to the path saved 
	in the sdcProblem. If the problem is loaded on a different computer than it was saved at,
	the storage path may be invalid and needs to be updated in the same way as described above.

Quiting sdcApp
------------------
To quit *sdcApp*, click on **Stop the GUI** under the header **Stop the interface** on the 
**About/Help** tab. It is recommended to quit *R* or *RStudio* after quitting *sdcApp* 
to ensure that nothing is left in the memory. This especially applies to a restart due
to *sdcApp* not responding.

Save SDC problem to continue working later. Possible once the SDC problem is defined.
